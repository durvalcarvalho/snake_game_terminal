Snake Game on Terminal

This project was made with the object to learn more about C language and game programing.

The challenge was to develop an interactive game on Linux terminal only using C language.

At first, I tried to use only use the standard libraries (Is possible to review this code on the first commit), but soon I realized that I would need a library to deal the the keyboard inputs. So I decided to use the [lncurses](http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html).

So, you need to install this library if it is not Installed by default on yout system.
[This is a cool tutorial that teaches you how to do](https://www.ostechnix.com/how-to-install-ncurses-library-in-linux/).

I din't finish this project (yet), I started to get frustrated with the time I was working on it, I was hoping it would only be a few days, So I started messing with something else, but someday I'll go back and work on this project again.

This project I improved on the following topics:

* I finally gave up reading small stackoverflow topics and embraced the lncurses documentation. [Documentation](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/)

* I became more familiar with pointers and dynamic allocation.

* I became more familiar with pointers and dynamic allocation.

* I got rid of the POO!! I can use structures !!!

Ps.:

To compile and execute the project I used the following command:

```
make all && make run
```
